For the last three months I've worked on the [Aerogear UnifiedPush Server](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unifiedpush-server) developing a proof of concept for utilizing Kafka producers, consumers and streams for push message routing and metrics analysis.

## What was done
With the help of our mentors, we managed to replace the Java Messaging System with a completely Kafka based workflow for push message routing: 

1. When the Push Notification Sender endpoint is invoked, a [Kafka producer](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unifiedpush-server/pull/896) in that endpoint produces the request with key/value pair (`PushApplication`, `InternalUnifiedPushMessage`) to the `agpush_pushMessageProcessing` topic. 

2. The [`Notification Router` streams class](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unifiedpush-server/pull/900) is initialized on application startup and begins its work when a message is sent to the above-mentioned topic. After some processing, it streams the push messages out (in the form of a `MessageHolderWithVariants` object) to 6 different output topics based on the message's variant type (Android, iOS, etc). 

3. The [`Token Loader` consumer](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unifiedpush-server/pull/900/commits/0d5407e62ce8b15c1daabda29b56f2e2b85d6cf3) listens for messages on the 6 streams output topics and after [further complicated processing](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unifiedpush-server/blob/5b268fcb80bd66a26b39147777061ff229ed39f9/push/sender/src/main/java/org/jboss/aerogear/unifiedpush/message/token/TokenLoader.java), loads batches of tokens for devices that match requested database parameters.

4. The messages with tokens are dispatched and received by the [`MessageHolderWithTokens` producer](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unifiedpush-server/blob/5b268fcb80bd66a26b39147777061ff229ed39f9/push/sender/src/main/java/org/jboss/aerogear/unifiedpush/message/kafka/MessageHolderWithTokensKafkaProducer.java) which produces each message to its respective topic (again, based on variant type). 

5. Finally, we have a [`MessageHolderWithTokens` consumer](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unifiedpush-server/blob/GSOC_2017_kafka/push/sender/src/main/java/org/jboss/aerogear/unifiedpush/message/kafka/MessageHolderWithTokensKafkaConsumer.java) which consumes the `MessageHolderWithTokens` objects and fires a CDI event. This event is handled on the other side by the [`NotificationDispatcher`](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unifiedpush-server/blob/GSOC_2017_kafka/push/sender/src/main/java/org/jboss/aerogear/unifiedpush/message/NotificationDispatcher.java), which sends each message to its appropriate push network (Adm, Apns, etc).
We decided to stick with CDI events over regular Producers and Consumers to offer an extra layer of abstraction.

We've also looked at Kafka for collecting and processing push related metrics. So far, we have topics for invalid tokens (which will be used for removing them from the database), push message failures and successes, and iOS-specific token failures and successes. 
We're currently working on a demo application that will read from these topics and perform processing on the data using Kafka Streams.

This work can all be broken down into the PRs, blog posts, and mailing list threads below (along with PRs by [Polina](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unifiedpush-server/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Apolinankoleva) and [Matthias](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unifiedpush-server/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Amatzew), not listed):

## What is left to do 
* **Migration to HBase**: Our project diverged naturally from the initial proposal. We encountered several unexpected roadbumps and we ran out of time for database migration (which is a huge task within itself). 

* **Unit and integration testing**: The UPS average code coverage percentage is quite low. Ideally I would liked to have be more thorough in the testing of our new branch, and improved the overall test coverage of the master branch. This is something we want to work on in the future.

* **Kafka Security**: Our final goal (as agreed upon with our mentors) was always a working proof of concept, as opposed to a production ready product. The remaining Jiras in our backlog are mostly related to security, which will be worked on after GSoC is over. 

* All other remaining tickets in our backlog can be found under the `gsoc_2017` label, [here](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AGPUSH-2187?jql=labels%20%3D%20gsoc_2017)
